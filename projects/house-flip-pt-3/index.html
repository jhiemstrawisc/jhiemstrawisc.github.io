<h1 id="the-basement----beginnings">The Basement &ndash; Beginnings</h1>
<p>Over our second summer in the house, with the progress in the backyard well underway, it was time to begin the process of finishing the basement &ndash; the largest individual undertaking we would shoulder in the entire flip.</p>
<p>As it stood, the basement was a large cobweb-encrusted concrete hole in the ground, containing little more than a washer and dryer, a broken water heater, several bales of unused blow-in insulation, a furnace inconveniently placed smack dab in the middle of the house, and a few haphazard heaps of my own and Z&rsquo;s personal belongings stacked along the outer walls. Those, too, had been overtaken by the burgeoning population of creepy crawlies that co-inhabited the house with us. In other words, it was the perfect opportunity to add some real value to the house!</p>
<p>The overall process of finishing a basement is long and complex, involving hefty doses of many types of construction &ndash; planning, permitting, framing, plumbing, electrical, and all the accoutrements that go into dressing up the rough-in work to make everything look spick and span. Needless to say, the planning step is extremely important because it not only gives a sense of how much the project will cost, but detailed CAD plans are required to obtain the building permits that allow work to commence (at least in Madison).</p>
<p>Now, we already had it in mind that we would prioritize adding three things: a second bathroom, a second living room (or similar recreational space), and a fourth bedroom. As luck would have it, the basement layout lent itself nicely to this, and to add a few extra finished square feet, we decided to throw in a large finished closet for extra storage. All we had to do was measure, sketch things out, and have the lovely C.N. CAD us up something more professional than my chicken-scratch drawing.</p>

<p>With a plan in hand, Z. and I loaded ourselves into the car and headed down to the city permitting office, an imposing, almost neo-colonial building replete with columns and towering glass windows. As this was the first time either of us had ever submitted building plans in our life, we were totally unsure of what to expect, and I&rsquo;d be lying to say I was anything but nervous for the first time my work would be seriously scrutinized by people who lived and breathed building code.</p>
<p>Almost as if to uphold what one might call the stereotypes of a city permitting inspector, standing behind the counter was a stooped elderly man with thick-rimmed glasses that sat low on his thin protrusion of a nose, making his eyes seem comically large &ndash; all the better for catching my mistakes. After explaining what our intents were and why were applying for the permit, the inspector unfurrled our plans, and after only a few moments of quickly scanning the proposal, gruffly blurted &ldquo;This will do.&rdquo; A quick stamp, and we were all set.</p>
<h2 id="egress-and-injury">Egress and Injury</h2>
<p>With the permiting squared away, it was time to begin the real work. However, while I had finished several basements with Z&rsquo;s uncle at this point in my life, there were a few things this project would entail that were totally beyond what I had done before, and I was nervous for the undertaking.</p>
<p>The first hurdle was that in order for us to build a &ldquo;legal&rdquo; bedroom, we would need to install an official egress window. This meant digging a <em>large</em> window well, cutting out a massive chunk of the foundation wall &ndash; the very thing holding the house up &ndash; and framing in both the window and the ground hole. The opportunities for making a mistake presented themselves everywhere in this process. In fact, several of those mistakes would shortly find themselves lodged in my uninsured forehead, but that&rsquo;s getting ahead of things.</p>
<p>At this point in my life I had dug many a hole; as a child, my father took the approach of &ldquo;responsibly lax&rdquo; parenting, and often let me get away with things that many other children would probably never have had the opportunity to do as kids. This included everything from homemade ziplines (they never ended well), bespoke boxcar buggies powered by one person peddling a unicycle horizontally mounted to some type of old metal frame while another steered the razor scooter duct taped to the other end, and DIY bottlerockets (that never left the ground). And lots of digging.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was my youthful infatuation with the book Holes, although I think things started even before then, but I&rsquo;d often get home from school, don a set of crusty jeans and boots, and continue working to enlarge one of the massive holes I had around the yard, many of which would later become muddy swimming pools. At one point, one of the holes had grown so large &ndash; maybe 5&rsquo;x8&rsquo; and some two Justins in depth &ndash; that I had to engineer my own excavation system, replete with pullies and yellow cat litter buckets for hoisting the dirt away. Unfortunately, while I had spent a lot of time coming up with a solution for removing the dirt, I neglected a solution for removing myself. At one point I quite literally dug myself into a hole that I couldn&rsquo;t get out of. I remember that when the neighbor heard my sad cries for help, he came over, saw my predicament, chuckled and quietly walked away. Needless to say, I did eventually devise a way out.</p>
<p>Anyway, when we were designing the basement, we decided against installing one of those ugly metal egress well barriers and opted instead to build a tiered, landscaped well out of 4x4 posts. Not only would this let more light into the eventual bedroom, but it also happened to be a slight loophole in the building code that gave us a bit more flexibility. The hole itself, maybe 5x8 and around one Justin in depth, took nearly 3 days to dig by hand in the late June sun. Little did we realize at the time that we&rsquo;d also be digging out the house&rsquo;s grounding rod &ndash; while we knew we were only feet from the house&rsquo;s electrical hookup, we had done the right thing by calling 811 (know before you dig!) to make sure there were no burried cables on the side of the electrial panel we needed to dig. Thankfully, we were able to re-ground things and nobody got fried in the process. With everything excavated (and piled all over the back yard, thankfully before we were up to any grass seeding), we had the room we needed to mark the foundation wall from both sides and cut the window well.</p>

<p>The process at this point was a bit muddy because I had never done this kind of concrete cutting. While I had demolished plenty of concrete, I hadn&rsquo;t done it in a situation where doing so could also shift an entire foundation, possibly destroying a $164,000 investment in the process. The process settled on was this: we would mark out where we wanted to cut on the inside of the wall in blue painter&rsquo;s tape. From here, we could take the Harbor Freight concrete drill I had acquired as payment for some work for my dad and do our very best to drill a level pilot/reference hole from the inside. If the hole went straight through the wall and didn&rsquo;t skew up or down or to the side, we could use the hole as a reference point from the outside to similarly mark the wall in blue painter&rsquo;s tape. As an extra precaution, we decided to erect a temporary support wall out of 2x4 inside the house and a few feet back from the soon-to-be window, just in case removing a large portion of the foundation caused any shifting.</p>

<p>The first issue at this point was that when we drilled a pilot hole through the poured concrete foundation, we measured it at 14&quot; thick. Not knowing what I was doing when it came to cutting foundations, and I decided the best course of action would be to rent a 9&quot; concrete saw from Home Depot and do our best to cut the wall from both inside and outside, doing our best to line up the cuts (I was wrong). Z had the foresight to declare he wanted no part in the actual cutting as it made him feel unsafe, and he was right because the problem with this approach shortly manifested itself into my forehead when the saw pinched on the inside of the wall and bucked back just above my right eyeball.</p>

<p>Luckily, my lineage is that of the Dutch Freesians, who are known to have thick skulls capable of absorbing even the largest of concrete cutting implements. Unluckily, I had been without health insurance for many years at this point in my life, but with that I had become fairly skilled at patching most things up myself. There&rsquo;s little that cannot be fixed with debriding spray, some skin glue, and a butterfly bandage!</p>
<p>This is a good spot for me to point out that knowing when to quit is an important life skill, and something I&rsquo;m still not the best at. After a quick patch (and Z convincing me not to try stitching my own face &ndash; I had gone so far as to YouTube a few suturing videos), I was stupidly eager to get back to work. Yet another hour or so of <em>gently</em> cutting with the concrete saw and the massive obelis of wall seemed ready to fall, but still couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to budge. We got out our Harbor Freight concrete hammer drill and started drilling out additional points along the edge, and consequently bringing about another concrete implement lodging itself into the same spot of my face when the drill bit wedged and started whipping the handle of the drill around.</p>
<p>My being slightly concussed and seeing stars, we decided to call it a day.</p>

<p>After a few days, when the swelling had subsided and I could open my left eye again, we got back to work &ndash; there was no shortage of things that needed to be done, especially because winter was coming and we now had a structurally unstable chunk of concrete <em>just</em> about ready to drop out of our wall. Luckily things were in a good spot. The wall just needed another zip around with the concrete drill, and once we could see light peaking out all around, we knew we were ready to repurpose the large lever used for prying out the <a href="https://justinhiemstra.com/projects/house-flip-pt-2">mythical stump</a> as a battering ram. For your viewing pleasure, we documented the process:</p>
